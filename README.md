Hi!
I need to do a form that autofills itself once the form is filled I need to insert the data in a html table dinamically I mean you can insert multiple records
in the table, every row should display a countdown timer of 2 hours, if the timer reaches 0 the row should turn in color red, and send an email.
Also every row should have and option a button  a text field to post a comment.And some buttons to insert current time

The process is like this:
1)Fill form
2)Insert data into html table
3)data displayed in table
4)display countdown timer of 2 hours in row inserted
(you can still add more rows while doing this just fill the form again)
5)while the times is running the table should have 4 buttons (step a, b ,c d) the purpose of this buttons is to capture the time 
6)if the timer reaches 0 the row should turn color red and be able to send and email
7)at the end of the process you should be able to post a comment with a button, text area or something like that
